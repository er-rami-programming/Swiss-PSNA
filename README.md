The Swiss Packet Sniffer and Network Analysis Tool is one of my first cybersecurity projects for python 3 and understanding pentesting and other tools. This isn't just for a career for me but a guide to understand how future pentesters like myself do this role or a beginners understanding on how it works.

Combining Packet Sniffing and Network Analysis all in one for myself and others. Maybe in the future i will look into other programming languages like MOJO but thats a after thought or idea
